                I've really been enjoying Harvard Extension School.  Thus far I've taken CSCI E-10A Java 1, CSCI E-10B Java 2, CSCI E-120 (now CS20) Discrete Math for Comp Sci, CSCI E-12 Fundamentals of Web Development, CSCI E-22 Data Structures, CSCI E-15 Dynamic Web Applications, and am currently taking DGMD E-20 this semester.  I am currently working full-time for a IT company.

            <h3 class="questions">What previous experience do you have with programming?</h3>
            <p class="answers">
                I have an undergrad in Electrical Engineering where I took a course on C.  I also had an internship on C/C++ programming many years ago at Boeing; however, I did not pursue it further until now.  I really enjoyed it at the time.  I also had an internship in 2014 doing PHP work with a company named ClickTripz generating new deeplinks.

            <h3 class="questions">Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h3>
            <p class="answers">
                I am using a PC with Windows 8.1.  I enjoy using PHPStorm and XAMPP, and am getting better with Linux as well.

                I have a wife and 2-year old daughter who I deeply love, but the terrible twos seriously impact my sanity!  We are trying preschool this semester, but then I deeply miss her!  For a while, I have been a stay-at-home dad, which has been rough, though also wonderful.  I really enjoy working from home.
