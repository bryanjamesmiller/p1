    <h3 class="questions">What previous experience do you have with programming?</h3>
    <p class="answers">
        I have an undergrad in Electrical Engineering where I took a course on C.&nbsp;  I also had an internship on C/C++ programming many years ago at Boeing; however, I did not pursue it further until now.&nbsp;  I really enjoyed it at the time.&nbsp;  I also had an internship in 2014 doing PHP work with a company named ClickTripz.&nbsp;  During the fall, I began working as a
        web developer for a company named BuddoBot where I got to do 100% of the coding for a product named TheDegreeTracker.&nbsp;  I really love HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and PHP.&nbsp;  I also enjoy Laravel and have been starting to learn more about CMS.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h3 class="questions">Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h3>
    <p class="answers">
        I am using a PC with Windows 8.&nbsp;1.&nbsp;  I enjoy using PHPStorm and XAMPP, and am getting better with Linux as well.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h3 class="questions">Anything else we should know?</h3>
    <p class="answers">
        I have a wife and 2-year old daughter who I deeply love, but the terrible twos seriously impact my sanity!  We are trying preschool this semester, but then I deeply miss her!  For a while, I have been a stay-at-home dad, which has been rough, though also wonderful.&nbsp;  I really enjoy working from home.&nbsp;
