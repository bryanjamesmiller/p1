            <p class="answers">
                I am in the midst of a career change, hoping to get into the field of web applications development or something related/similar.  So far I've taken CSCI E-10A Java 1, CSCI E-10B Java 2, CSCI E-22 Discrete Math for Comp Sci, and CSCI E-12 Fundamentals of Web Development.  I am also taking CSCI E-22 Data Structures this semester.  I am not working at all right now, and am looking for a job.  However, I am  enjoying courses at Harvard Extension School.
            </p>
            <h3 class="questions">Why are you taking this course?</h3>
            <p class="answers">
                I would love to learn how to make dynamic web pages and further my basic PHP skills.  I also need to learn MySQL as it seems like every job description requires it or similar database skills.  I also look forward to exercising my HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GitHub skills, which are pretty basic.
            </p>
            <h3 class="questions">What previous experience do you have with programming?</h3>
            <p class="answers">
                I have an undergrad in Electrical Engineering where I took a course on C.  I also had an internship on C many years ago; however, I did not pursue it further until now.  I really enjoyed it at the time.  I did manage to obtain an internship last summer in PHP work, but it was pretty basic PHP work.  I am hoping that company may hire me again next summer, but uncertain.  
            </p>
            <h3 class="questions">Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h3>
            <p class="answers">
                I am using a PC with Windows 8.1.  I also have VMWare and Kubuntu installed which I used for my internship, but don't plan on using it for this class.
            </p>
            <h3 class="questions">Anything else we should know?</h3>
            <p class="answers">
                I have a wife and 2-year old daughter who I deeply love, but the terrible twos seriously impact my sanity!  We are trying preschool this semester, but then I deeply miss her!  For a while, I have been a stay-at-home dad, which has been rough, though also wonderful.
