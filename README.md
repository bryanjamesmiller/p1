Problem Set 1 for CSCI E-15

##Live URL of my P1:  
http://p1.grat.xyz/

##Description of the project:  
This is just a basic website with links to my future problem set web pages and github account links.  
There is also some information about me on the website in answer to the questions that were asked in the assignment.

##Demo information:  
I do not believe we are required to do a demo for this first problem set assignment.

##A list of any plugins, libraries, packages or outside code used in the project:  I did utilize some code I found on http://www.storiesinflight.com/html5/ and it was this:

background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(white, #0033CC);
background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(white, #0033CC);
background-image: -o-linear-gradient(white, #0033CC);
background-image: linear-gradient(white, #0033CC);

However, I changed all of the colors (the only thing that can be changed... the rest of the code is required).
